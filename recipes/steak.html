        A lucious steak recipe accompanied with a tangy, spicy sauce.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>    
        <li>2 Sirlion steaks</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Oyster sauce</li>   
        <li>Palm sugar</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Lime juice</li>
        <li>Fish sauce</li>
        <li>Tamarind paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, oil, palm sugar, and ground black pepper in a bowl until combined. Let the steaks marinate in the sauce while you prepare the nam jim jaew.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the sticky rice to the pan and toss/stir continuously until the grains have become golden brown in color.</li>
        <li>Transfer the toasted grains to a mortar and pestle and grind the rice until you achieve a coarse powder.</li>
        <li>Add in the lime juice, fish sauce, tamarind paste, palm sugar, chopped cilantro, Thai chili flakes, and shallots. Mix until well combined and adjust accordingly to tastes.</li>
        <li>Heat a heavy bottom pan or iron skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the steaks for 2-3 minutes on each side for a rare to medium-rare steak (you may also cook the steak longer until you reach our desired level of doneness).</li>
        <li>Let the steaks rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with the nam jim jaew sauce and fresh vegetables. Enjoy!</li>

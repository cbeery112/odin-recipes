        <ol>

                before submerging under boiled water from the kettle for 30 mins</li>

            <li>Finely dice the onion and garlic and add the onion to the pan once the meat is browned and removed from the pan. Add the garlic once the onions have turned translucent and soft. </li>
            <li>Using a food processor or blender remove the rehydrated chillis and blend them into a puree then add the puree and meat back to the pan with the onions and garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes along with a half cup of chilli powder, cumin powder and dried oregano. </li>
            <li>Add the stock and bring the pot to the boil before covering and reducing the heat down to simmer for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Add salt and black pepper to taste when serving, finish with juice of limes.</li>
